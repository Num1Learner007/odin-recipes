    <h3>Description</h3>
    <a>If you are looking for a pasta dish that you can pair with a glass of red wine and snuggle up in a blanket to eat, this is it. A meaty comfort food that is vegan and filling all in one! I like to make a big pot of this at the beginning of the fall and freeze portions so that when a cold rainy day comes, All I have to do is warm it up in a pot and in 10 minutes I have a full flavored snack.</a>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup carrots, small diced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups celery, diced</li>
        <li>4-6 cloves of garlic, rough chopped</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh oregano</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1/3 cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup red wine</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup blakc lentils</li>
        <li>3 medium tomatoes, diced with juices</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups veggie stock</li>
        <li>3/4 cup hemp seeds</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot or dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saute for 2-3 minutes stirring until fragrant. Lower heat to medium, then add the carrots, celery, garlic, salt, pepper, chili flakes, and herbs.  Saute 7-8 minutes, stirring.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato paste, browning it just a bit in the pan (this will deepen the flavor), then deglaze with wine if you want, scraping up any brown bits.  Once most of the wine has cooked off add the tomatoes and their juices, cook them down for just a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the lentils, veggie stock and hemp seeds or walnuts.  Bring to a boil, cover tightly, lower heat to low, and simmer gently 20-25 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. Uncover.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking uncovered until most of the liquid has cooked off.  Stir in the balsamic vinegar, taste, and adjust salt, pepper, vinegar and chili flakes to your liking. Keep in mind, you want this just slightly salty if tossing with pasta.</li>
