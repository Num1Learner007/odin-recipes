First ODIN Project
Hey, this is my first project in the Odin coursework.
I had a great time figuring everything out and I feel like the ODIN coursework is the right path for me. I look forward to learning with this community and this feels like a great victory that will spur me on through the rest of the projects in the curriculum. Thank for checking this out, I look forward to finding out what else I'll be figuring out how to create.
